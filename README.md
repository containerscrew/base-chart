# base-chart

Use this chart to deploy your custom applications in Kubernetes.

> [!INFO]
> Imagine having 10 private code repositories in your Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket. Each application is deployed in Kubernetes using a helm chart. Are you going to have to create one chart per application? Are you going to keep the changes of 10 charts when it is the same? If you only need one chart to deploy a single application (deployment, service, ingress/Gateway APi...) why don't you keep one base chart for all apps?```
